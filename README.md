## Prerequisities

0. CMake (version 3.16.3 tested)
1. ViSP (version 3.4.1 tested)
2. OpenCV (version 4 tested)
3. libPeR_base (version 0.0.3 tested, https://github.com/PerceptionRobotique/libPeR_base)

## Running the program

To run the program, just make the `launch_dual2dual.sh` executable with a `chmod a+x launch_dual2dual.sh` and run it from the command line.

Don't forget to adjust the parameters of the program before launching it.

## About the images

1. Download and unzip examples of equirectangular images in the media directory downloaded from : https://mis.u-picardie.fr/~g-caron/data/2023_SVMISplus_er-0-9.zip (not publicly available for the moment; later, please see the SVMISplus official website https://mis.u-picardie.fr/~g-caron/datasets for the full list of image sequences)
2. run from the command line
   ./equi2equi-build/equi2equi ./2023_SVMISplus_er-0-9/SVMISplus/Matrice600Pro/SixDOFs/Images_Equirectangular/ 0 9 1 ./2023_SVMISplus_er-0-9/SVMISplus/Matrice600Pro/SixDOFs/camera_poses.txt
   command line arguments are:

- imagesDir directory where equirectangular images to read (with 'e*' followed with 6 digits before the extension) are and where the output transformed equirectangular images will be written (with characters 'te*' before 6 digits)
- iFirst the number of the first image to transform
- iLast the number of the last image to transform
- iStep (optional if none after) the increment to the next image to transform
- posesFic (optional if none after) a text file of one 3D pose per image (one row - one image) stored as the 3 elements of the translation vector followed by the 3 elements of the axis-angle vector representation of the rotation
- iInvertPose (optional) a flag to let the program knows if poses of posesFic must be applied to images as they are or inversed

TODO: remove boost dependencies currently obtained through ViSP
